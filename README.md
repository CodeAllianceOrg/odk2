This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

We make heavy use of the following dependencies:

- [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and [@angular-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/store)
- [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
- [Bootstrap 4 beta](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [ng-bootstrap](https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap)
- [dragula](https://github.com/bevacqua/dragula) and [ng2-dragula](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-dragula)

## Pull Requests

To submit changes, please [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Please use the following checklist as a guideline:

- Are all tests passing?
    - `npm run test`
    - `npm run e2e`
    - `npm run lint`
    - `npm run build`
- Did the pull request include a description of all changes? Does it account for any new or updated dependencies?
- Does the pull request solve more than one problem? Could it be broken down into several, independent PRs?

It's important to note that these are only guidelines and can and should be broken when appropriate. However a healthy code culture can be more easily cultivated when we all agree to and follow a set of simple rules.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
